This is a graphical password authentication interface. 
We built this using the following languages and frameworks :
1. Html5
2. css:3
3. Bootstrap
4. js:6
5. Flask(python framework)
6. MySqlite
Remembering passwords for different applications must be quite tiresome. 
This application uses image-based and position-based graphical password login system which makes it easier for the user to login without 
having to remember each and every password of different websites.
This application also prevents your personal information from getting
leaked in public and hence is more efficient to use.
